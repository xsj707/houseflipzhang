  description:
    "In what can only be described as the most ambitious international collaboration in architectural history, Tom the Cat and Jerry the Mouse traveled to South Korea for a three-month intensive design residency that would change the face of Korean cultural architecture forever. The project began when the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration, impressed by their previous work on the Ping Pong Pavilion, invited the dynamic duo to design a new national museum complex. Tom and Jerry, never ones to shy away from a challenge (or a good adventure), packed their drafting tools and set off for Seoul. The three-month design process was a masterclass in cross-cultural collaboration. Tom, with his meticulous attention to detail and love of grand, sweeping spaces, designed the main exhibition halls—spaces so vast and elegant that visitors would feel like they were walking through history itself. Jerry, drawing on his expertise in space optimization and his ability to see the world from unique perspectives (literally—he's very small), focused on creating intimate gallery spaces and innovative display systems that would showcase Korean artifacts in ways never seen before. The design process wasn't without its challenges. Tom insisted on marble floors throughout ('for easy cleaning and that satisfying echo when you walk'), while Jerry argued for warmer materials that would create a more inviting atmosphere. They compromised by using traditional Korean hanok-inspired wood elements combined with modern materials—a fusion that perfectly represents both the historical significance and contemporary vision of the museum. The exhibition spaces feature floor-to-ceiling display walls covered with architectural presentation boards, detailed floor plans, and photorealistic renderings. The main hall includes multiple architectural models displayed on minimalist pedestals, allowing visitors to see the design process from concept to completion. Tom's contribution is most visible in the grand scale of the spaces and the precision of the structural elements, while Jerry's influence can be seen in the clever use of natural light, the intimate viewing areas, and the way the space guides visitors through a carefully choreographed journey. The project took exactly three months to complete, during which Tom and Jerry became local celebrities in Seoul's architectural community. They even learned enough Korean to discuss design concepts with local craftsmen, though most conversations still involved a lot of pointing and enthusiastic gesturing. The museum complex now stands as a testament to what can be achieved when two very different perspectives—one grand and elegant, one detailed and intimate—come together to create something truly extraordinary.",
